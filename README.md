**Business Case**
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is focused on improving operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and financial performance. To support these goals, the executive team requires a comprehensive dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights into patient admissions, readmissions, average length of stay, average costs, and insurance coverage for procedures. This data-driven approach aims to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall hospital performance.
