#### Overview
**Project Name:** NA_RetailSupplyChainSalesAnalysis  
**Objective:** To analyze and optimize the North American retail supply chain sales performance.

#### Business Problem
A leading retail company in North America is facing challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, leading to stockouts, overstock situations, and suboptimal sales performance. The company needs a comprehensive analysis to understand the sales trends, inventory levels, and supply chain efficiency.

#### Approach
- **Data Collection:** Gathered sales data, inventory levels, and supply chain logistics from various sources across North America.
- **Data Integration:** Integrated data into Power BI, creating a unified dataset for analysis.
- **KPI Identification:** Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales volume, inventory turnover, stockout rates, and order fulfillment times.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize sales trends, inventory levels, and supply chain efficiency.

#### Key Insights
- **Sales Trends:** Identified peak sales periods and high-performing products.
- **Inventory Management:** Highlighted areas with frequent stockouts and overstock situations.
- **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** Pinpointed delays in order fulfillment and areas for improvement in logistics.


### Project 2: Statista_CoL_DE

#### Overview
**Project Name:** Statista_CoL_DE  
**Objective:** To analyze the cost of living (CoL) data in Germany using Statista data.

#### Business Problem
Understanding the cost of living across different regions in Germany is critical for businesses, policymakers, and individuals for making informed decisions. There is a need for a detailed analysis of CoL data to identify regional disparities and trends.

#### Approach
- **Data Collection:** Acquired cost of living data from Statista, including expenses related to housing, groceries, transportation, and healthcare across various German cities.
- **Data Integration:** Compiled and cleaned the data in Power BI for accurate analysis.
- **KPI Identification:** Established key metrics such as average rent, grocery prices, transportation costs, and overall CoL index.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Built interactive dashboards to visualize CoL differences across German cities and over time.

#### Key Insights
- **Regional Disparities:** Identified significant variations in living costs between cities like Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg.
- **Expense Breakdown:** Provided a detailed breakdown of major expense categories contributing to the overall CoL.
- **Trends Over Time:** Tracked changes in the cost of living over the past few years, highlighting inflationary trends.

#### Impact
- **Business Strategy:** Helped businesses tailor their salary structures and relocation packages based on regional CoL data.
- **Policy Making:** Provided valuable insights for policymakers to address regional inequalities and plan economic interventions.
- **Individual Decision Making:** Assisted individuals in making informed decisions about relocation and budgeting.

## Project 3: Maven Hospital Challenge

### Challenge Objective

For the Maven Hospital Challenge, you’ll play the role of an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

You’ve been asked to build a high-level KPI report for the executive team, based on a subset of patient records. The purpose of the report is to give stakeholders visibility into the hospital’s recent performance, and answer the following questions:

- How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
- How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average?
- How much is the average cost per visit?
- How many procedures are covered by insurance?

The dashboard should scale to accommodate new data over time, but the CEO has asked you to summarize any insights you can derive from the sample provided.

### Project Description

#### Business Case
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is focused on improving operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and financial performance. To support these goals, the executive team requires a comprehensive dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights into patient admissions, readmissions, average length of stay, average costs, and insurance coverage for procedures. This data-driven approach aims to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall hospital performance.

#### Key Insights
1. **Patient Readmissions**: The readmission rate stands at 18%, indicating a need to investigate underlying causes and implement strategies to reduce readmissions.
2. **Average Cost per Visit**: The average cost per visit is $3.6K, highlighting areas where cost efficiency can be improved.
3. **Average Length of Stay**: Patients are staying for an average of 0.3 days, which seems low and may require a review of discharge processes or data accuracy.
4. **Procedures Covered by Insurance**: A total of 12,110 procedures are covered, showing strong insurance coverage but also indicating potential areas for negotiation with payers.
5. **Distinct Patients by County**: Suffolk County has the highest number of distinct patients at 644, suggesting targeted outreach or resource allocation for that area.
6. **Claim Costs by Payer**: A significant portion of claims, $49.26M, are from patients with no insurance, which impacts hospital finances and necessitates strategies for better patient insurance coverage.

#### Impact Driven
- **Operational Efficiency**: By identifying high readmission rates and average costs, the hospital can implement targeted interventions to improve patient care and reduce unnecessary expenses.
- **Resource Allocation**: Insights into patient demographics and county-wise distribution enable better planning and allocation of resources to meet patient needs effectively.
- **Financial Performance**: Understanding claim costs by payer helps in strategizing negotiations and improving insurance coverage, thereby enhancing the hospital's financial stability.
