About this project
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is focused on improving operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and financial performance. To support these goals, the executive team requires a comprehensive dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights into patient admissions, readmissions, average length of stay, average costs, and insurance coverage for procedures. This data-driven approach aims to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall hospital performance.

Key Insights

Patient Readmissions: The readmission rate stands at 18%, indicating a need to investigate underlying causes and implement strategies to reduce readmissions. Average Cost per Visit: The average cost per visit is $3.6K, highlighting areas where cost efficiency can be improved. Average Length of Stay: Patients are staying for an average of 0.3 days, which seems low and may require a review of discharge processes or data accuracy. Procedures Covered by Insurance: A total of 12,110 procedures are covered, showing strong insurance coverage but also indicating potential areas for negotiation with payers. Distinct Patients by County: Suffolk County has the highest number of distinct patients at 644, suggesting targeted outreach or resource allocation for that area. Claim Costs by Payer: A significant portion of claims, $49.26M, are from patients with no insurance, which impacts hospital finances and necessitates strategies for better patient insurance coverage.

Impact Driven

Operational Efficiency: By identifying high readmission rates and average costs, the hospital can implement targeted interventions to improve patient care and reduce unnecessary expenses. Resource Allocation: Insights into patient demographics and county-wise distribution enable better planning and allocation of resources to meet patient needs effectively. Financial Performance: Understanding claim costs by payer helps in strategizing negotiations and improving insurance coverage, thereby enhancing the hospital's financial stability.
